# New Year’s Eve

iOS for New Year’s Eve party. It's the menu for my home bar. Guests used to get more details about drinks written on my whiteboard wall, and I used it to remember all of the recipes.

## Building

Xcode 7b3 is required. You'll need to get Bar's dependencies with [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage).
